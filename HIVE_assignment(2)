GROUP BY
  st
ORDER BY
  num_banks DESC

## Q1_2: Found how many banks were closed each year. The result must show the year and the number of banks closed on that year, order by year.

## Q2: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2020/qzdf-xmn8 Check hive database named “chicago”, 
## there is one table named: crime_parquet: include data from 2001-present

## Q2_1: In your own database, create a partitioned table(partitionedby year)to store data, store in parquet format.Name the table “crime_parquet_16_20”;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS kuan_db.crime_parquet_16_20(
  ID int,
  case_number int,
  'date' bigint,
  block string,
  IUCR string,
  primary_type string,
  description string,
  location_description string,
  Arrest boolean,
  domestic boolean,
  beat string,
  district int,
  ward string,
  community_area string,
  FBI_code int,
  x_coordinate string,
  Y_Coordinate string,
  updated_on string,
  latitude float,
  longitude float,
  location string
)
PARTITIONED BY (yr int)
STORED AS parquetfile;


#Q2_2:Import 2016 to 2020 data into the partitioned table from table chicago.crime_parquet.

SET hive.exec.dynamic.partition = true;
SET hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode = nonstrict;

INSERT INTO kuan_db.crime_parquet_16_20 PARTITION(yr) 
SELECT
  ID,
  case_number,
  'date',
  block,
  IUCR,
  primary_type,
  description,
  location_description,
  Arrest,
  domestic,
  beat,
  district,
  ward,
  community_area,
  FBI_code,
  x_coordinate,
  Y_Coordinate,
  updated_on,
  latitude,
  longitude,
  location,
  yr
FROM
  crime_parquet
WHERE 
  yr BETWEEN "2016" AND "2020";
